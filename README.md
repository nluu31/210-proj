# My Personal Project - Expert



## About the project:
For my term project in CPSC 210, I plan on creating an application that helps students study for exams within in school. The application will work by self-inputting questions/topics with their own written answers. Once you have recorded these questions and answers,there will be a feature that will allow you to "quiz yourself" by choosing a random question/topic written by the user alongside four answers to other questions(including a correct answer). It will serve as a multiple choice quiz. This application will be designed towards students and scholars looking to study in different ways. This project is of interest to me because I often just blurt out notes and look for quizzes online to challenge my memory. Creating this  app combines the two features and will hopefully allow for a similar approach to studying like I always have.

Alongside a multiple choice function, there will also be a true or false question and even a written answer. The written answer cannot be manually graded but will show the recorded answer afterwards. An example of this app in action could be that you record around 10-15 questions into the system and then click on a "quiz me" button. After which, the app will prompt you into a multiple choice/true or false/written answer quiz that will challenge you to pick the right answers in a "test" setting.
